# WebGLp5Instancing
This library adds instancing to p5.js through the beginShape() &amp; endShape() feature although it does require WebGL2 from https://github.com/RandomGamingDev/WebGL2p5

Simply include the p5.js library and then add WebGL2 to p5.js by including https://github.com/RandomGamingDev/WebGL2p5 and then after that include this library to add the count parameter after the MODE parameter where you put number of instances you're creating.

To use it you can simply include https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/RandomGamingDev/WebGLp5Instancing/webglp5instancing.js in your HTML file! If you want to you can also just download the file and include it in your HTML file that way.

btw stuff updates so remember to specify a version/commit for your library if you want to use a link and don't want your code to automatically update to the newest version of the library
